### Running slackbot2 Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

Starting slackbot2 locally by running:
	
    HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=APP-TOKEN-GENERATED-BY-SLACK ./bin/hubot --adapter slack
	
You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    slackbot2>

Then you can interact with slackbot2 by typing `slackbot2 help`.

    slackbot2> slackbot2 help
    slackbot2 help - Displays all of the help commands that slackbot2 knows about.
